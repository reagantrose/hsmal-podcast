Is gardening just a hobby for little old ladies? Could it really be said that there is a manliness to gardening? In this episode, we discuss what the Bible teaches about gardening and how it connects to the purpose God gave mankind in Genesis. We survey what the Bible teaches about gardening before the fall, after the fall, and even on the new earth. We also share our own experiences in learning to grow gardens, and reflect on numerous benefits gardening has for you.
