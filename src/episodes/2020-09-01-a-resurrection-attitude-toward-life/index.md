# Show notes

The Scriptures make clear that the ultimate future which awaits believers is a physical resurrection of the body. Sadly, most Christians are either ignorant of this doctrine or have not considered the implications of this blessed truth. In this episode, Reagan and Miska consider what the doctrine of resurrection says about Christ, our salvation, and about how a man should live.
